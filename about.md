I'm a front-end web developer and a Software Engineering student in Lyon, France.
I'm passionate writing beautiful and effective Javascript code for fluid user interfaces.

My passions are __open-source__ software and fighting for a __free and open web__ for everyone.

###Work Experience###
In the summer of 2014 I worked as an Intern at the Firefox Engineering Team, implementing support for high DPI displays (Retina) and some other front-end awesomeness.

For 10 months in 2012/13 I worked for École Française de Comptabilité, the leader in financial distance education in France. In charge of redeveloping the complete web environment, I managed to increase the ROI of the main web site more than 120%.

I've been working as a freelance web developer since 2008, mostly using the LAMP stack.


###Education###
I'm currently enrolled as a Software Engineering student at [INSA de Lyon](http://insa-lyon.fr/en).
My expected graduation date is the summer of 2016 and I'm always looking for some fun internships.

I have a _DUT_ (associates degree) in IT from University Lyon 1, obtained in 2013. In my final project, I lead a team of four through the development of a Git-based data warehouse and web interface. This self-hosted cloud storage and sharing system was developed for the [laboratory of biometry and evolutive biology](http://lbbe.univ-lyon1.fr/?lang=en).

###Other fun stuff###
I love to contribute code and be part of open-source software communities, like Mozilla Firefox.

I volunteered at the [WWW Conference 2012](http://www2012.org/), in Lyon/France.

I worked at the [Technical Solidarity Lab](http://www.soltec.ufrj.br/) at <abbr title="Rio de Janeiro Federal University">UFRJ</abbr>, making a [web portal](http://cidadededeus.org.br/) for the _Favela_ of "City of God" (Cidade de Deus). In this project, we did some action research using the process of developing a new web site as a mean of social change.
