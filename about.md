I'm brazilian, so let's talk about samba and soccer. Or maybe not. ðŸ˜ƒ

I'm a full-stack web developer and Software Engineering student in Lyon, France.
I love writing beautiful and performant javascript code for a responsive and dinamic user experience.

My passions are __open-source__ software and fighting for a __free and open web__ for everyone.

###Work Experience###
I'm currently working as an intern at the Firefox Engineering Team, expanding the support for high resolution screens and some other front-end awesomeness.

During 10 months in 2012/13 I worked for Ã‰cole FranÃ§aise de ComptabilitÃ©, the leader in financial distance education in France. In charge of redeveloping the complete web environment, I managed to increase the ROI of the main website more than 120%.

I've been working as a freelance web developer since 2008, mostly using the LAMP stack.


###Education###
I'm currently enrolled as a Software Engineer student at [INSA de Lyon](http://insa-lyon.fr/en).
My expected graduation date is summer 2016 and I'm always looking for some fun internships.

I have a _DUT_ (associates degree) in IT from University Lyon 1, obtained in 2013. In my final project, I lead a team of 4 through the development of a Git-based data warehouse and web interface. This self-hosted cloud storage and sharing system was developed for the [laboratory of biometry and evolutive biology](http://lbbe.univ-lyon1.fr/?lang=en).

###Other fun stuff###
Love to contribute code and be part of the community of open-source softwares like Mozilla Firefox.

Volunteered at the [WWW Conference 2012](http://www2012.org/), in Lyon/France.

Worked with the [Technical Solidarity Lab](http://www.soltec.ufrj.br/) at UFRJ, making a [web portal](http://cidadededeus.org.br/) for the City of God (Cidade de Deus) slum. In this project, we did some action research using the development process of a website as a mean of social change.
