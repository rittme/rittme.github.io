I'm a __Computer Sciences Engineering student__ and a __Front-End Web Developer__ in Lyon, France.
I'm passionate about writing beautiful and effective code for fluid user interfaces.

I love the __open-source__ software and fighting for a __free and open web__ for everyone.

###Work Experience###
In the summers of 2014 and 2015 I worked as an Intern at the Firefox Engineering Team.

In 2015 I worked at the password manager team, building better user interfaces. Take a look at [this blog post]({% post_url 2015-09-28-firefox-password-manager-intro %}) where I write about what I did.

In 2014 I implemented [support for high DPI displays (Retina) in favicons]({% post_url 2014-09-15-firefox-high-dpi-favicons %}) and some other front-end awesomeness.

For 10 months in 2012/13 I worked for [École Française de Comptabilité](http://efcformation.com/), the leader in financial distance education in France. In charge of redeveloping the complete web environment, I managed to __increase the ROI of the main web site by more than 120%__.

I've been working as a freelance web developer since 2008, mostly using the LAMP stack.

###Education###
I'm currently enrolled as a Computer Sciences Engineering student at [INSA Lyon](http://insa-lyon.fr/en), in France. This winter I'm doing an exchange semester at [Chalmers University of Technology](http://www.chalmers.se/en/Pages/default.aspx), in Gothenburg, Sweden.
My expected graduation date is the summer of 2016 and I'm always looking for some fun internships.

I have a _DUT_ (associates degree) in IT from University Lyon 1, obtained in 2013. In my final project, I lead a team of four through the development of a Git-based data warehouse and web interface. This self-hosted cloud storage and sharing system was developed for the [laboratory of biometry and evolution biology](http://lbbe.univ-lyon1.fr/?lang=en).

###Other fun stuff###
I love to contribute code and be part of open-source software communities, like Mozilla Firefox. One personal project I've been working on is [BZ Board](https://github.com/BZBoard/bzboard), an easier Bug Management Interface. It's a Kanban board to help teams and developers at Mozilla to manage their work.

I volunteered at the [WWW Conference 2012](http://www2012.org/), in Lyon/France.

I worked at the [Technical Solidarity Lab](http://www.soltec.ufrj.br/) at <abbr title="Rio de Janeiro Federal University">UFRJ</abbr>, making a [web portal](http://cidadededeus.org.br/) for the _Favela_ of "City of God" (Cidade de Deus). In this project, we did some action research using the process of developing a new web site as a mean of social change.
